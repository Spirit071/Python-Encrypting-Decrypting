# Python-Encrypting-Decrypting
How to encrypt and decrypt messages in python? Here you go!

I used a method that changes the ASCII value of each character in the string and returns it as the output.
The logic behind it is called "one-time-pad", which means the key to the encryption is only valid once. 
Therefore, it should be unsolvable(for each character there are 5000 possiblities for the solution).
